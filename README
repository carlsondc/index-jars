some quick scripts for indexing all .jar files on a *nix system.

./findJars.sh will scare them all up, pipe this to ./indexJars.sh to
get the results.

The output format is 

(S|C) packages.and.class /full/path/to/jar


Where "S" is in the first column if we found a .java file, "C" is in
the first column if it's .class.

This index also includes anonymous inner classes.
